# Already Implemented 
1. FastAPI Initialization: The application is initialized using FastAPI, with a title set to "TestAPI".
2. Environment Configuration: The application loads environment variables from a corresponding .env file based on the APP_ENV variable, allowing for different configurations for development, testing, and production environments.
3. Database Configuration: It retrieves the DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY from the environment variables, which are essential for database connectivity and security.
4. Item Model: A Pydantic model named Item is defined, which includes fields such as name, description, price, and is_available. This model is used for data validation and serialization.
5. API Endpoints:
-  create_item: An endpoint to create a new item in the database.
-  get_item: An endpoint to retrieve a specific item by its ID.
-  list_items: An endpoint to list items with pagination (skip and limit parameters).
-  get_docs: A function to generate API documentation in HTML format.
-  get_docs_json: A function to generate API documentation in JSON format.
6. Database Initialization: There is a mention of initializing database tables on startup, indicating that the application sets up necessary database structures when it starts.
7. Documentation: Generate API documentation in HTML and JSON formats.

# Features To Implement
1. Pagination: Add pagination to the list_items endpoint, allowing users to navigate through a list of items in chunks.
2. Authentication: Implement authentication to secure access to certain endpoints.
3. Authorization: Implement authorization to control access to specific endpoints based on user roles.
4. Error Handling: Implement error handling to handle exceptions and return appropriate responses.
5. Testing: Add unit and integration tests to ensure the application's functionality.
6. Dockerization: Dockerize the application, allowing it to run in a containerized environment.
7. CI/CD: Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automatic builds, tests, and deployments.
8. Monitoring: Set up monitoring tools to monitor the application's performance and health.
9. Logging: Implement logging to capture important events and errors.

# Extending the API
1. Add additional endpoints for different operations, such as updating an item or deleting an item.
2. Implement additional features, such as searching for items, filtering items based on certain criteria.
3. Integrate with external services, such as payment gateways or third-party APIs.
4. Add caching to improve performance.
5. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
6. Add a user interface for easy interaction with the API.
